Topic: A rotten apple

Content: (Photo of a rotten apple.) Text: (In the lower left, "Team Apple Seed NYC"

Speaker's notes: 

NYC.gov's user interface and search is broken. We know this and this is why we are here. To illustrate this point, the NYC.gov search for "lost luggage" brought me to the DOT events calendar. Parking brought me to the Partnership for Parks. A search for schools returned the second result as Independent Budget office. This is one rotten apple.

Topic: "The Seed"

Content: (Photo of a seed.) Text: "Renewal"

Speaker's notes:

To grow a new apple, we must start from a seed. Within the context search on NYC.gov, resources take precedence over human written content. For a new apple to grow, search results must return resources not content.

Topic: Modern alternatives

Content: (screen shots of Utah.gov, Alpha.UK.gov, Search.USA.gov, my.FCC.gov, wdyl.com)

Speaker's notes:

Around the internets, government websites are starting a new. Curated content sites, weighed down with bureaucratic approval process and burdened with budget cuts, are seen as clunky, dated, and unhelpful. Customizable, constituent centric tools are taking their place. Search.USA.gov, Utah.gov, Alpha.UK.gov and my.FCC.gov are all constituent centric tools.
