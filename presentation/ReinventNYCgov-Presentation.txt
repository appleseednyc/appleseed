Topic: A rotten apple

Content: (Photo of a rotten apple.) Text: (In the lower left, "Team Apple Seed NYC"

Speaker's notes: 

NYC.gov's user interface and search is broken. We know this and this is why we are here. To illustrate this point, the NYC.gov search for "lost luggage" brought me to the DOT events calendar. Parking brought me to the Partnership for Parks. A search for schools returned the second result as Independent Budget office. This is one rotten apple.

Topic: "The Seed"

Content: (Photo of a seed.) Text: "Renewal"

Speaker's notes:

To grow a new apple, we must start from a seed. The current NYC.gov layout & primary navigation contradicts the City's own report for Digital Future. No where on NYC.gov will we find the top 10 things constituents are seeking. As time passes, how do we build a site that adapts to the user context? 

Within the context of search, the City's own data proves resources take precedence over human written content. For a new apple to grow, search results must return resources not content. Moving forward the site must return result based on intent.

Topic: Modern alternatives

Content: (screen shots of Utah.gov, Alpha.UK.gov, Search.USA.gov, my.FCC.gov, wdyl.com)

Speaker's notes:

Around the internets, government websites are starting a new. Curated content sites, weighed down with bureaucratic approval process and burdened with budget cuts, are seen as clunky, dated, and unhelpful. Customizable, constituent centric tools are taking their place. Search.USA.gov, Utah.gov, Alpha.UK.gov and my.FCC.gov are all constituent centric tools. These sites return results based on intent and desire.

Topic: Our Team's Goal

Content:

0 Breakfast
1 Consistent User Experience
2 Clean User Experience
3 Push & Pull interfaces (SMS, Shareablity, Trigger actions)
4 Context aware search interfaces
5 Participatory via commentablity

Speaker's notes:

In redesigning NYC.gov, Team Apple Seed's goals are simple. We will win by creating a consistent and clean user interface, offer push and pull systems with context aware search. Note, these systems don't just offer up content. They are a solid foundation for adaptive constituent digital services. 

Just as NYCStat has made the City more responsive to its users, we invision an NYC.gov that is adaptive, responsive and personable.

Topic: Government desires / refined goals

Content:

- A site for the user that is simple
- Search Centric
- Personalized
- ubiquitous
- Push & Pull
- API
- Eliminates paperwork

Speaker's notes:

Through out the last 24 hours, we asked every government official for their input and their advice on our platform. We received a frank viewpoint. They said, "Make it simple", "have it work for the citizen", "Look at 311", "Make it Gov 2 Gov". Oh and "the Mayor likes his iPad".

Topic: User Matrix

Content:

User Context
- Big Web
- Little Web / Application friendly
- SMS friendly

User Roll
- Gov 2 Gov
- Resident
- Non-Resident


Speaker's notes:

To accomplish our goals we sought out three user contexts: the big web, aka the desktop; the little web, the mobile browser, and "App" friendly; short messaging service. We combined this with the three basic user rolls: Gov-2-Gov, a la 311; an NYC Resident; a non-NYC resident.

Topic: a new apple

Content: (a picture of a new apple)

Speaker's notes:

To move NYC.gov to the 21st Century, some compromises will need to be made. Nationalarchives.gov.uk and archive.org's "wayback machine" provide excellent frameworks for archiving old, agency driven content. In the 21st century there are no 404's, archived content is presented and indicated as such. This type of thinking will clear the way for perpetual iteration. The innovation of NYC.gov does not need to be held back by its legacy. They can co-exist as one site, delineated by time.

In the 21st century, NYC.gov, now visible at betaNYC.org, will be influenced by the same responsive mechanisms that influence 311 and the City's Mayor's performance report. Your actions, weither they be online or by the phone, will build a composite view of future government resources. Regardless of user, realtime sentant understanding of the city's needs are place front and center through our search driven user interface.
